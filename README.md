Time is running out to upgrade to Windows. Microsoft no longer offers support for Windows 7, and now the company has launched new Windows. If you're still running an older version of Windows, keep in mind that new Windows will only be available as a free upgrade for Windows 10 users, not older versions. Anyone on older operating systems will have to pay to upgrade.
